- Fixed persistent blank tooltip when hovering over empty GUI slots by introducing a config toggle to disable filler panes.
- Hardened GUI protections to prevent moving items on Business GUI screens by cancelling both click and drag interactions while a `BusinessGUI` is open.

### üîß Config
- New key in `config.yml`:
  - `gui.useFillerPanes` (default: `true`) ‚Äî when `false`, empty GUI slots are left empty to avoid hover tooltips.

## Version 1.0.4 - "Admin Economy Fixes & i18n" (August 2025)

### ‚ú® Improvements

- Added quick-access commands `/business gui` and `/business menu` (with tab completion) to open the business GUI faster. Permission: `djeconomy.gui.access`.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

- Confirmation threshold/expiry correctly use `FileConfiguration#get*` overloads with defaults.
- Guarded against missing economy manager and send `admin.economy_unavailable` message.
- i18n keys and placeholders aligned for give/take/set, confirm prompts, expiry, offline notes, and reload success.

### üß™ Testing
- AdminCommand economy edge cases and messages integration tests are green in CI.
- Verified confirmation prompt and expiry window behavior using the time seam.
- Verified offline player path triggers `depositPlayer` and correct messages.

### üìö Docs
- Verified `README.md`, `USER_MANUAL.md`, and `permissions.yml` alignment with behavior.

---

## Version 1.0.3 - "Admin Economy Confirmation & Tests" (August 2025)

  - `give` executes immediately for small amounts (online)
  - `take` executes when sufficient balance (online/offline)
  - `set` executes for online and offline players
- Added confirmation expiry test for large transactions using a testable time seam (no sleeps).

### üîß Code
- Introduced a time seam in `AdminCommand` via `nowMillis()`.
- Refactored `PendingAdminAction.isExpired(long now)` and updated all call sites.
- Behavior unchanged for players; enables reliable automated testing of expiry.

- Verified `permissions.yml`, `README.md`, and `USER_MANUAL.md` align with implementation.
- Documented large-amount confirmation and 30s expiry window.
- CI: All tests green.
