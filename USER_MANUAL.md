Notes:
- Refresh/Invalidate require the player to be online.

#### Tab Completion
- Admin tab completion is case-insensitive and permission-aware at the root.
- Player name suggestions appear for the second argument of `setlevel`, `getlevel`, `resetlevel`, `addxp`, `refreshjobs`, `invalidatejobs`, and `history`.
- For `economy`, suggestions:
  - Second argument: `give`, `take`, `set`.
  - Third argument: online player names.
- For `setlevel` and `addxp`, the third argument suggests job names (case-insensitive).
- For `history`, the optional third argument suggests limits like `5`, `10`, `20`, `50`.
