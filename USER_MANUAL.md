### **üõ°Ô∏è Admin Commands**

Admins can grant full access with `djeconomy.admin` or use granular nodes per subcommand:

```
/djeconomy reload
  Reload configuration. (perm: djeconomy.system.reload)

/djeconomy getlevel <player> <job>
  Show a player's job level (online/offline). (perm: djeconomy.admin.level.get)

/djeconomy setlevel <player> <job> <level>
  Set a player's job level (online/offline). (perm: djeconomy.admin.level.set)

/djeconomy resetlevel <player> <job>
  Reset a player's job level to 1 (online/offline). (perm: djeconomy.admin.level.reset)

/djeconomy addxp <player> <job> <amount>
  Add XP to a player's job (online only; must have joined the job). (perm: djeconomy.admin.level.addxp)

/djeconomy economy <give|take|set> <player> <amount>
  Manage player money; supports online/offline. (perm: djeconomy.admin.economy)
  - Negative amounts rejected; extremely large amounts rejected.
  - Large amounts at or above the configured threshold require confirmation within the configured expiry window using `/djeconomy confirm`.
  - If attempting to take more than the player's balance, the message shown is: `¬ßcPlayer only has $<amount>!` (amount formatted to two decimals).
  - Messages are localized via `src/main/resources/messages.yml` using keys: `admin.give_success`, `admin.take_insufficient`, `admin.take_success`, `admin.set_success`.

/djeconomy confirm
  Confirm the last pending large economy action. (perm: djeconomy.admin.economy)

/djeconomy history <player> [page] [size]
  View recent admin economy actions for a player. (perm: djeconomy.admin.history.view)

/djeconomy doctor
  Run system diagnostics. (perm: djeconomy.system.doctor)

/djeconomy businessinfo [businessName]
  View global or per-business stats. (perm: djeconomy.admin.businessinfo)

/djeconomy refreshjobs <player>
  Reload a player's job data from DB (online only). (perm: djeconomy.admin.jobs.refresh)

/djeconomy invalidatejobs <player>
  Invalidate a player's cached job data (online only). (perm: djeconomy.admin.jobs.invalidate)
```

Notes:
- Refresh/Invalidate require the player to be online.
- History displays are paginated; use `[page] [size]` (size clamped, defaults applied on invalid input). If no entries or file is missing, a friendly message is shown.
- Economy large-amount confirmation prevents accidental big changes. When a large action is initiated, you'll be prompted to type a reason in chat; it's stored with the pending confirmation and recorded in history on `/djeconomy confirm`. Configure behavior via `economy.admin_confirmation.threshold` and `economy.admin_confirmation.expiry_seconds` in `config.yml`, then apply with `/djeconomy reload`.

#### Tab Completion
- Admin tab completion is case-insensitive and permission-aware at the root.
- Player name suggestions appear for the second argument of `setlevel`, `getlevel`, `resetlevel`, `addxp`, `refreshjobs`, `invalidatejobs`, and `history`.
- For `economy`, suggestions:
  - Second argument: `give`, `take`, `set`.
  - Third argument: online player names.
- For `setlevel` and `addxp`, the third argument suggests job names (case-insensitive).
- For `history`, optional arguments suggest page numbers and sizes (e.g., pages: `1`, `2`, `3`; sizes: `10`, `20`, `50`).

### **üõ†Ô∏è Admin Setup Quick Reference**

- Vault (optional): Install Vault and a compatible economy plugin. In `config.yml` set `integrations.vault.enabled: true` and `integrations.vault.use_vault_economy: true`. Without Vault, the internal economy is used.
- Database: Default `sqlite`. For MySQL, update `database` in `config.yml`:
  ```yaml
  database:
    type: mysql
    mysql:
      host: localhost
      port: 3306
      database: dynamicjobs
      username: your_user
      password: your_pass
      useSSL: false
  ```
- Permissions:
  - Admin: `djeconomy.admin`
  - Granular: `djeconomy.system.reload`, `djeconomy.system.doctor`, `djeconomy.admin.businessinfo`, `djeconomy.admin.economy`, `djeconomy.admin.level.get|set|reset|addxp`, `djeconomy.admin.history.view`, `djeconomy.admin.jobs.refresh|invalidate`
  - Admin Economy GUI: `djeconomy.gui.admin.economy`, `djeconomy.gui.admin.economy.balance.view`, `djeconomy.gui.admin.economy.balance.modify`, `djeconomy.gui.admin.economy.history.view`, `djeconomy.gui.admin.economy.confirm.manage`
  - Player GUI: `djeconomy.gui.access`
- Large-amount safety: Configure `economy.admin_confirmation.threshold` and `expiry_seconds` in `config.yml`. You'll be prompted to provide a reason in chat; it will be stored and applied when you `/djeconomy confirm`.

### **üß™ Admin Testing**

- __Unit tests__ (fast):
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

- __Integration tests (SQLite only)__:
  ```bash
  mvn -P integration-tests test
  ```
  Runs tests tagged `integration` while excluding those tagged `docker`.

- __Integration tests including Docker (MySQL via Testcontainers)__:
  - Windows PowerShell:
    ```powershell
    $env:DJE_DOCKER='true'; mvn -P integration-tests-docker test; Remove-Item Env:DJE_DOCKER
    ```
  The MySQL test is additionally guarded by `@EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable(name = "DJE_DOCKER", matches = "true")` to avoid accidental Docker startup on machines without Docker.

### **üÜò Troubleshooting**

#### **Common Issues:**

**"Not earning money from job activities"**
- Check you've joined the job: `/jobs stats`

- Some blocks may not count (check with admin)

**"Can't create business"**

- Business name might be taken
- Check you have permission

**"Gig commands not working"**
