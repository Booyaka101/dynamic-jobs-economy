### **üõ°Ô∏è Admin Commands**

Admins with `djeconomy.admin` can manage jobs, economy, and cache:

```
/djeconomy reload
  Reloads configuration and refreshes managers.

/djeconomy setlevel <player> <job> <level>
  Sets a player's job level. Works for online and offline players.
  - Job name is case-insensitive.
  - Level is clamped to the job's valid range.

/djeconomy addxp <player> <job> <amount>
  Adds XP to a player's job (online only).
  - Job name is case-insensitive.
  - Player must have joined the job.

/djeconomy refreshjobs <player>
  Immediately reloads a player's job data from the database (online only).

/djeconomy invalidatejobs <player>
  Invalidates the player's cached job data so it reloads on next access (online only).
```

Notes:
- Refresh/Invalidate are restricted to online players to keep cache handling consistent.
- Setting level for online players updates cache + DB; for offline players it upserts directly to DB.

#### Tab Completion
- Admin tab completion is case-insensitive.
- Player name suggestions appear when typing the second argument for `setlevel`, `addxp`, `refreshjobs`, and `invalidatejobs`.
- For `economy`, suggestions:
  - Second argument: `give`, `take`, `set`.
  - Third argument: online player names.
- For `setlevel` and `addxp`, the third argument suggests job names (case-insensitive).
